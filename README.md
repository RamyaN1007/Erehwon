# Erehwon

Erehwon is an on-line collaborative tool for connecting people involved in socio-political interventions, building communities of interest, and enabling and empowering civic engagement in socio-political activities in public spaces by sharing and exchanging methods, values and practices, beyond spatial territories and physical borders. The project was conceived by Beatriz Cantinho and Mariza Dima, and has been developed with the support of Osso Cultural Association, Queen Mary University of London, and Stress.fm.  

For more information on the project: (http://www.osso.pt/en/adrift/erehwon-3)

The prototype tool was created over a hackathon weekend on the 28th and 29th May 2016.
