<p>Erehwon is an on-line collaborative tool for connecting people involved in socio-political
interventions, building communities of interest, and enabling and empowering civic engagement
in socio-political activities in public spaces by sharing and exchanging methods, values and
practices, beyond spatial territories and physical borders. The project was conceived by
Beatriz Cantinho and Mariza Dima, and has been developed with the support of Osso Cultural Association,
Queen Mary University of London, and Stress.fm. For more information on the project visit:
